# Voice Assistant - Omni
Omni is a simple voice assistant built with Python. It can perform various tasks such as playing a song on YouTube, telling the current time and weather, searching for information on Wikipedia and Google, and telling jokes.

## Requirements
To run the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3
- pywhatkit
- wikipedia
- pyjokes
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- pywikihow
You can install these libraries by running the following command:

`pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia pyjokes requests BeautifulSoup4 pywikihow`

## Usage
To use the voice assistant, run the following command:
`python omni.py`

After running the command, Omni will start listening to your commands. You can give commands by speaking into the microphone. Some examples of commands you can give are:

- "play song name"
- "what is the time"
- "what is the weather in city name"
- "who is person name"
- "tell me a joke"
- "search google for query"
- "how to do something"
Omni will respond to your commands and perform the requested task.

## Future Work
This is a basic implementation of a voice assistant. You can add more functionalities to it by integrating with other APIs or services, such as a calendar or reminder service, email service, or social media platforms. Additionally, you can improve the accuracy of speech recognition and natural language processing by training the model with more data.
